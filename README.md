# COVID-Image-Recognition-Project
This project is an attempt to use chest X-Ray scans of Cononavirus patients to predict patient survival. I build a CNN to classify the training data and analyze my findings below. The data/dataloader and some of the inspiration for the questions asked by the project can be found at https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset/
